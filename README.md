# Django CMS Based Blog App
This project was developed to learn about Django Framework. I used Django Framework, Django Templates, JavaScript, Bootstrap knowledge doing this work. This project may look 
like a boilterplate project as I did not finish the work with adding multiple users, reply and other functionalities. Rather I used it as a base project to develop any
Django CMS projects such as dashboard applications.
